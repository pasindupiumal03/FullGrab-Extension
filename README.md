## ✨ Key Features

### 🛡️ Smart Privacy (Auto-Blur Sensitive Data)

FullGrab instantly detects and blurs sensitive information before your capture is saved — including:

- ✅ Email addresses
- ✅ Credit card numbers
- ✅ Phone numbers
- ✅ Physical addresses
- ✅ Login credentials
- ✅ Personal identifiers

**No extra editing. No accidental oversharing.**  
Your privacy is protected automatically.

### 🎥 High-Res Video Export (MP4 & GIF)

Static screenshots are good. Scrolling video captures are better.

FullGrab records the entire scroll and exports it in:
- **MP4** (High Resolution)
- **GIF** (Smooth & Lightweight)

Perfect for tutorials, UX reviews, demos, bug reports, and content creation.

### ☁️ Cloud Auto-Save (Free Up Local Storage)

Every capture — image or video — can be automatically saved to your cloud space to keep your device uncluttered.

- ✅ No manual uploading
- ✅ No storage pressure on your local drive
- ✅ Access your captures from anywhere

A perfect solution for teams, creators, and power users.

### 🔗 One-Click Shareable Link

Once your capture is ready, FullGrab generates a shareable link you can send to:

- Teammates
- Clients
- Developers
- Project managers
- QA testers

**No downloading. No attaching. No delays.**  
Just capture → share → done.
